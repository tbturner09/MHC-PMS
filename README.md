The youtube demo can be found at this URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yZjkXKYGuk&feature=youtu.be

To access the system run the EXE program.

Test credinials are the following:

Usernames:
Manager
Nurse
Receptionist

the password for all of them is "password"
These are just test account so the password is not really a concern =]
In actual implementation users will have to create their passwords based upon a password policy.
